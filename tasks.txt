The main goal is described either in README.md and in main.rs.

Starting simple, at some point i will need to monitor the performance for this program to make it light and not fuck me while im playing or whatever.

[x] Capture Keys and mouse movement.
  [x] See how can i capturate events.
  [x] Check the type of the event.
  [x] Store values.
[FAILED] Keys are not being capture while inside an vm, need to fix that.
 [REASON] will be a pain in my ass to find which function vmware uses to capture keyboard(it's probably in kernel mode or even more deep) and also i would have to hook AND modify to library to make it work, im just gonna have both life monitors running in windows and linux as well since im using rdev library and can just cross compiler for win easily.

[X] Check running apps always after some time.
  [ ] Check the amount of time that i spent at different apps.
  [ ] Need to create some logic to get some better results.

[ ] Create tests - optinal
[ ] Send data to a api dont even know how i'm gonna do this 
[ ] Create the website
