The main goal is described either in README.md and in main.rs.
Starting simple, at some point i will need to monitor the performance for this program to make it light and not fuck me while im playing or whatever.

[x] Track keys and mouse movement.
  [x] See how can i capture events.
  [x] Check the type of the event.
  [x] Store values.
  [FAILED] Keys are not being capture while inside an vm, need to fix that.
    [REASON] ==> It would be a pain in my ass to hook vmware keyboard driver, probably i would need to put less effort if i write code from both platforms and have the code running out and in the vm.
[x] Track active window.
  [x] Get active windows.
  [x] Understand how to write code to run in multiple threads. obs: i did not get it all yet, but its working so i will be moving.
  [x] Have it working for linux as well.
[x] Create a system tray.
[ ] Track time based of active window. 
[ ] Create db to save data.
